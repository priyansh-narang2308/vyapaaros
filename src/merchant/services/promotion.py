This service integrates with the Promotion Agent (NAT) to calculate
dynamic discounts based on inventory levels and competitor pricing.

Architecture:
- Layer 1: Deterministic computation (signals, allowed actions)
- Layer 2: LLM arbitration (call Promotion Agent REST API)
- Layer 3: Deterministic execution (apply discount)

This module includes:
- Enums for actions, signals, and reason codes
- TypedDicts for input/output formats
- Constants for thresholds and discount mappings
- Async client for calling the Promotion Agent REST API
- Service functions for the 3-layer logic

All prices are in CENTS (e.g., 2500 = $25.00).
